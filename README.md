=====

Check ast with interpreter with : ./interpret < testcase_filename
All test cases need a main() function.

To do: elif, arrayops

Thursday: WE ARE FINISHED!


stuff to remember for check:
assignments
int_type must be int_lit or id -> id of type must be int_type, pitch_type, duration_type
string can be string_type or id which is of string_type
frac can be fract_lit or id which can be gract_type or duration_type
array can be array_lit array_lit must have type corgi_prim and 
      id and can have type of int, lit, fraction, 


operation
add, subtract, mulitply, divide, = < , >, <=, >=
 can be applied to (l op r) where l and r are the same type, potential types are int, pitch, duration, tuples
 duration type fract type 

 operations under chords, tuples, 

 expr 1 is duration, expression 2 can be fract, duration, int

 if type of binop is duration, then expr1 and expr2 



 add, subtract, multiply, divide -> 

 you can't multiply or divide or less than/leq/greater than/geq to any arrays
 expr1 op expr2 - if the op is anything but access, then you have to match type of expr1, expr2  


 precedence 
 duration, fraction, int

 int,pitch

 tuple is two elements
